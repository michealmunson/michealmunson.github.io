<font size ="-1">I've gotta take a little time / A little time to think things over / I better read between the lines / In case I need it when I'm older / This mountain, I must climb / Feels like a world upon my shoulders / Through the clouds, I see love shine / Keeps me warm as life grows colder / In my life, there's been heartache and pain / I don't know if I can face it again / Can't stop now, I've traveled so far / To change this lonely life / I wanna know what love is / I want you to show me / I wanna feel what love is / I know you can show me</font>

## Introduction

I've emphasized love in my relationships with people--be it friends, family, girlfriends, whatever--for as long as I could remember. I think this trait is not just inherent to me but to all humans. We rely our happiness on them and them us. I think it's beautiful. At the same time however I, and many others I am certain, have also felt a lot of pain derived from these relationships. 

This page is an exploration of that topic, namely love. What is it? How does it elicit such strong emotional responses from us? Why are there so many timeless songs about it? Whats the relationship between love and sex? Can there be love without sex? All these questions will be explored in the below posts. This page is about learning and thinking critically. Therefore I may or may not currently share opinions with what is written below.
