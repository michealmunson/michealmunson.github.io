Aim of post - 

Help people develop some intuition behind what the mean and standard deviation of a set of data points is. The point is to take them through the idea that the mean is just center of mass for a set of a points. Its a weighted average. The variance is the difference from how all the points are spread apart, normalized to how many points there actually. Why do we end up square-rooting the variance? Why does that help us better understand a distribution's variance?
