I've been blessed with the opportunity to learn some jiu jitsu. After doing some research, I've learned a few things. Foremostly that jiu jitsu is technique-heavy. It is not insane to see a lightweight woman with some training take down some untrained heavyweight dude. Technique rules in this sport. I've also learned that it is totally possible for people who have started the sport later (i.e., not as some young child) able to perform in high-tier competitions. There is some organization called IBJJF (International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation) founded by some guy with the last name Gracie. I've come across that name a lot of times while researching BJJ. 

As with any martial art, there are weight classes. For IBJJF, I am in the *Ultra Heavy* class, since I'm above 190.7 pounds. That sounds horrific. I'm not trying to sumo-wrestle. With that said, I'm going to have to cut some weight. This page will be a record of that journey.
