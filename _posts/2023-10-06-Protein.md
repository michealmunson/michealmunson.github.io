# **Introduction**
Let's begin with defining what a protein is. A protein is a collection of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms bonded together in a very particular fashion. Below is a figure of myoglobin, a protein found in abundance in mammalian skeletal muscle.

This figure is a structural representation of myoglobin using a .pdb file obtained from the Protein Data Bank, a public resource containing structural data for biological molecules. The spheres that make up the figure above represent amino acids. Amino acids are the subunits that a protein is composed of. In a protein, amino acids bond to one another in a series, one-after-the-other, and then fold (similar to a string of yarn that is folded into a ball). This folded structure of amino acids is the protein. In myoglobin particularly, there are 154 amino acids all ordered in a specific sequence (all of which are shown below for your convenience). Amino acids are abbreviated with a one-letter representation. For example, the very first amino acid of myoglobin is V, which stands for Valine.

Besides serving as the structural building block for proteins, amino acids serve other functions as well. They may function as the starting material in glucogenesis, the process whereby our bodies produce its own glucose molecules. Amino acids may also function as signalling molecules between neurons allowing our nervous system to adequately communicate with other tissue types in our body. In short, amino acids are foundational to many of our body's daily operations.

Nonetheless, when a human consumes proteins, they are consuming something liken to the myoglobin shown above. Depending upon the food, the proteins will change. In other words, different organisms are composed of different proteins. For example, eating a chicken's egg will offer different proteins than eating the muscle on a cow's rib. Continuing with this example of myoglobin, suppose someone ate some red meat (muscle tissue chockful of myoglobin from some animal like a cow or pig for example), they are very likely to have that animal's myoglobins travel through their digestive tract and provide them the "protein" they desire.

Along with the myoglobin traversing down the eater's gastrointestinal tract, a number of other proteins await their digestion. Three of which are shown below. The point here is that eating different foods which are composed of proteins will offer a different set of proteins to you.

</p>

With these ideas in mind, we can now properly define protein digestion. Protein digestion is the breaking down of the proteins in our food (myoglobin, actin, myosin, or troponin for example) into their respective amino acids. Then with those amino acids, our bodies may do useful operations.

# **Journey From Food to Bloodstream**

Alright, so lets dive into the digestive process. You cut off a piece of your favorite, protein-acious meal. The first thing you ought to be doing if you plan on using that food for some actual good is putting it in your mouth.

**The Mouth and Esophagus**

<p align="center">
  <img src="/mouth_anatomy.jpeg" alt="mouth and esophagus anatomy" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"/>
</p>

Your mouth contains 2 tools to immediately start breaking down food. Namely, (i) teeth for breaking up the food into smaller pieces and (ii) saliva for mediating chemical reactions (like dissolving starch) and lubrication. In the case of our meal, the teeth break the meal up into smaller pieces and the saliva lubricates the food to then travel down your esophagus. There are no chemical reactions concerning protein in the mouth. Similarly, the esophagus is simply a conduit bridging the mouth to the stomach. There is no direct breaking down of the proteins in the esophagus.

**The Stomach**

<figure align="center">
<p align="center">
<img src="/Stomach_Lining.jpeg" alt="stomach lining" style="height: 250px; width: 250px;"/>
</p>
<figcaption>
<i>The inner lining of the stomach shown via an endoscopy. You can see the stomach is ridged. Columnar cells line the stomach. These cells release alkaline fluids to protect against the acidic fluid produce by other cells. The stomach is also peppered with gastric pits which house a variety of other cell types to produce the acidic gastric juice the stomach carries. </i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

The bolus of food has successfully traversed the pink landscape of the esophagus and has now found itself in the acidic environment of the stomach's lumen (a lumen is just the empty space of some biological structure. Arteries for example have lumens such that blood may travel through them). 

The stomach's inner lining is dotted with invaginations called gastric pits--like deep craters on the moon, except in this case these craters are brimful of acid. The concoction for protein breakdown originates within these gastric pits. These pits are lined with cells that produce 2 compounds capable of breaking down proteins: hydrochloric acid and pepsin.

Lets start with the acid. Hydrochloric acid, a hydrogen atom weakly bonded to a chlorine atom, is a very strong acid and is the reason why gastric juice is so acidic. Most proteins do not do well in acidic environments. Recall the myoglobin shown previously. The acidic environment will cause the myoglobin to unfold exposing all the amino acids to the surrounding environment. Pepsin, which is readily available in an acidic environment, then cuts the 154-unit long (if the protein was myoglobin) string of amino acids into smaller strings of amino acids. 

For aficionados, pepsin cleaves the N-terminal side of aliphatic amino acids like methionine, leucine, tryptophan, etc. The partially digested protein then travels through a tight knot looking structure, called the pyloric sphincter, regulating the flow of contents in the stomach to the small intestine.

<i>A peptide (which is a string of amino acids) 6 amino acids long that would be cleaved by a variety of peptidases. A peptidase is an enzyme capable of cleaving proteins into their individual amino acids. You can see pepsin as part of this list. The other peptidases are available in other areas of the body.</i>

**The Small Intestine**

<figure align="center">
<p align="center">
<img src="/duodenum.jpeg" alt="duodenum" style="height: 250px; width: 250px;"/>
</p>
<figcaption>
<i>The inner lining of the upper small intestine, called the duodenum, made possible via endoscopy. The white arrow is pointing at villi which are a series of peaks and valleys on the surface of the duodenum. These villi are chockful of capillaries to facilitate the travel of the nutritious compounds extracted from the food into our bloodstream.</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

The small intestine is the last stop before proteins are successfully broken down and absorbed into our bloodstream for some actual use. Once the acidic gastric juice shipping our partially digested proteins interfaces with the small intestine, an alkaline compound, in this case bicarbonate, neutralizes the acidic stomach fluid. The organ responsible for injecting this neutralizer is the pancreas. 

In addition to ameliorating the gastric juice for the small intestine, the pancreas injects peptidases other than pepsin, like chymotrypsin, trypsin, and carboxypeptidase into the small intestine as well. These compounds complete the catabolic (i.e., breaking down of biological molecules) process by breaking down the small chunks of amino acids into smaller chunks 3-, 2- or even 1-amino acid long. 

At this length, the amino acids are capable of migrating across the inner lining of the small intestine and into our bloodstream. For a little more depth, the epithelium of the small intestine, like the stomach, is also folded into a series of peaks and valleys. These peaks are called villi and on each peak, you have smaller peaks and valleys, of which are called microvilli. Bordering these microvilli, are transporters that facilitate the passage of peptides and amino acids across them and eventually into our capillaries. A discussion of this process warrants a whole new post (which may very likely be explored through this blog). Whether it is or not, I recommend you do some research--it can get interesting!

**The Blood Vessels**

Amino acids and peptides are capable of directly dissolving in our blood. So when these compounds travel through our enterocytes they immediately enter the bloodstream through capillaries embedded within our villi. 

<figure align="center">
<p align="center">
<img src="/capillaries_villi.jpeg" alt="capillaries in villi" style="height: 300px; width: 250px;"/>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>

These capillaries then converge into a larger blood vessel called the hepatic portal vein. Hepatic is another term for the liver. This vein leads to the liver which then does its own operations with all the amino acids we just absorbed. This is also a whole can of worms and will be discussed in the next post. Regardless of what the next post is--voila! You just took the journey a protein would take from its original source (i.e., the food itself) to the bloodstream of its captor! There are plenty of disorders associated with this pathway that (of course) affect protein digestion and thus all the downstream operations that rely on protein digestion. That is also for another day.
