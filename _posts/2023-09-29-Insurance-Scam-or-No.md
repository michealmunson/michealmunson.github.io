I just recently (and brainlessly) paid for my car insurance policy again. But this time, for whatever reason, it got me thinking. Is insurance worth it or not? A friend of mine swears by it. Better safe than sorry he claims. And I bet you a lot of Americans think the same thing.

If you're unfamiliar with the logic, it goes like this:

> There are some costs in my life that are just unpredictable. If these things happen, I most certainly cannot afford their cost. Therefore, I am going to pay someone who will eat this outrageous cost for me.

Here are some scenarios of this logic working out:

**Case 1: Unpredictable health circumstance**

I pay $500 a month to cover my health expenses (the more applicable version of this is that my company pays my monthly premiums, which in theory would have went to my paycheck but thanks to tax deduction, I actually benefit by my company paying for the insurance). Two years down the road, I have a baby and due to unforeseen complications the baby ends up in a neonatal intensive care unit that costs upwards of $300K. I just therefore saved at least $288K.

**Case 2: Automobile accident**

I pay $60 a month in case I crash my car. Three years in, I get in an accident and sprained the other party's ankle in the process. I'm at fault and I now have to cover the expenses to repair the other party's damages to both their car and themselves. This would've cost me $15K but my trusty auto insurance has me covered. I just saved $13K.

In the above cases, of which I have either personally experienced or have read about, insurance seems like a no-brainer. But what about all the other forms of insurances? Below is a non-exhaustive list of insurances you can have

- Health insurance
- Automobile insurance
- Life insurance (this is intended to cover your loved ones in the event that you die)
- Property insurance (covers any unintended damage done to your property)
- Wedding insurance (intended to cover any accidents or damages that occur at the wedding)
- Protection from flight cancellation (intended to cover your flight costs in case you can no longer make it)
- Kidnapping insurance (insurance company will pay the ransom for you if kidnapped)
- Spoiled food insurance (some home owner's insurances actually will reimburse you if your food spoils due to a power outage, for example)

As you can see, you can pretty much pay someone to cover the risk of almost anything - from an expensive health service all the way to spoiled wagyu. I don't want to be the guy to tell you that one thing is more valuable than the other, for all I know you actually do care more about your spoiled food over your healthcare. But from a cost perspective, some insurance policies are just better than others. In fact, sometimes you don't have a choice. As of 2023, you can't even legally drive without automobile insurance in every state (except for New Hampshire).

With that said, I think its important to recognize one thing all these insurance companies have in common. 

> Whether they cover car accidents or ransoms for the occasional kidnapping, they charge you enough money such that they can cover your costs, pay their employees, and leave a nice slice of the pie for their shareholders. 

These insurance companies have statisticians (called Actuaries) that calculate the cost your type of person will bring them. Say your a stunt-double who performs in major Hollywood action movies. You're sure-as-heck going to be charged larger premiums for Life Insurance than the 22 year-old who's never had a health complication in her life. It's the name of the game. You're paying for comfortability and assurance.

As with all things, opting for extreme behavior when deciding whether you should opt for insurance is a bad idea. Never purchase any insurance? Unless you're this guy

you probably should be buying insurance sometimes. On the other hand, if you're always paying insurance, it's probably time for you to take some control of your life. For some things, you can just decrease the likelihood of that thing happening. For example, instead of paying extra on your Homeowners insurance to cover spoiled food, purchase a backup power generator. You'll likely need one in the event of a power outage anyway. For health insurance (assuming your employer doesn't provide coverage), you can opt for cheaper plans and lead a healthier life. Of course, for some the locus of control is a lot less than for others. But the more control you have, the less you'll need insurance. Need to cover a crack in your home's floor because of an earthquake? Learn how to patch it up yourself and save yourself the extra money you'd spend monthly in case of an earthquake large enough to split your hardwood floors. 

Before purchasing insurance, I'd do my research. What's the likelihood of what I'm paying to get covered for the average American? Am I that average American? If not, is it more or less likely to happen to me? If it does happen to me, what cost will I have to incur? Can I afford this cost? 

These are tough questions to answer, but they'll certainly guide you to making a well-informed decision about whether you want to mindlessly dump money into some company taking advantage of your fears.
