Idea is to post an article analyzing all the proteins found in a chunk of skeletal muscle isolated from a cow or some other animal. You want a list of all the proteins, their DNA sequence, their RNA sequence, their protein sequence, their structures, etc. Can this published as a paper?

Food for thought
    - The proteins associated with a particular organ may change over time. Furthermore, what types of proteins are you interested in? Structural proteins only? What about proteins where its respective concentration in the organ change depending upon some event?
