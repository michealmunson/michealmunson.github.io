## Introduction

The liver is the next organ amino acids ought to encounter once absorbed into our bloodstream. From there the amino acids are processed in some way. Either they stay in the liver for further processing or they go to another tissue for further processing. The following possible functions to be done on amino acids are:

- Use them to make glucose<br>
- Distribute them to other tissues so that those tissues may benefit from these amino acids<br>
- Turn them into proteins<br>
- Use them to make other compounds (nucleotides, other AAs, hormones, neuromodulators, creatine, etc)<br>

Below, we will explore the operations the liver may perform on amino acids to do our body some good.

## 1. Glucose production

Lets start with glucose. Glucose is a compound our body relies on for energy. Most of the carbohydrates we eat will be broken down into glucose. Glucose itself is then further broken down producing adenosine triphosphate (also known as ATP) as a product. This ATP is potential energy our body uses--converting this molecule into other forms of energy and getting work done.

Most of the cells in our body are capable of using several compounds for energy production--whether it be fats, sugars, or amino acids. Some cells however only rely on glucose. Red blood cells are an example. Hence without glucose, our red blood cells would be unable to perform any work. 

Our liver is responsible for producing said glucose if our body needs it. It does this by turning a subset of amino acids--13 amino acids to be precise--into glucose. This process is called glucogenesis. The majority (~40% to ~70%) of glucogenesis is done with alanine and glutamine as starting material. Its purported that the liver processes mainly alanine into glucose and the kidney glutamine. This was hypothesized because of the liver's preference for alanine uptake, the kidney's preference for glutamine uptake, and the fact that the kidney lacks enzymes necessary for alanine metabolism.

Focussing on the liver's ability to produce glucose, hepatocytes, AKA liver cells, have an enzyme called alanine aminotransferase. Alanine aminotranferase's function is to transform 2 molecules--alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate--into pyruvate and glutamate--respectively. The name is likely a homage to pyruvate being produced because glucogenesis is such a pivotal function in our body.

The reaction is the trade of the amine group (-NH3) from alanine for the carbonyl group (=O) in alpha-ketoglutarate. When the alanine's amine is substituted with a carbonyl, that product is no longer alanine but pyruvate. Pyruvate then undergoes a series of other reactions to become glucose. </i>

Glucogenesis is purported to occur in the night time.
