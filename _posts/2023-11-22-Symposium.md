## Summary
<p>0. Context</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Socrates is at a banquet with friends. They are celebrating Agathon at his home. Over some alcohol, Eryximachus, a friend at the banquet, challenges everyone to offer a praise to love.
</p>
</font>
<p>1. Phaedrus</p>
 <font size="-1">
 <p>
 - Love is the best thing we can have because we feel the most ashamed in front of our lovers. Imagine that you've just done something embarassing like fumble a speech at some celebration. We'd feel the most embarassed when our lover is there as a witness as opposed to when our lover is absent. The assumption here is that because we feel the most shame in front of someone we love, we care most about what they must think of us. This is a sign that love is one of the most important things to us.<br>
 - Only lovers are willing to die on behalf of one another. The fact that people are willing to put their life on the line over love shows its importance and the respect we ought to have for love.

<p>2. Pausanias/Eryximachus</p>
 <font size ="-1">
 <p>
 - Love is an action and we can ascribe whether love is beautiful or ugly ourselves. Consider the act of pressing a knife into someone's chest. If done by a surgeon on a patient, the act may be labeled heroic. If done by a thief on the street, the act is criminal. It is the same with acts of love. We need to inquire about why the action was done to determine if love is beautiful or ugly. All in all then, love is beautiful if done beautifully and shameful if done shamefully.<br>
 - Points to a broader issue of emotionally-loaded language. Pausanias thinks that love is not an emotionally loaded word. An example of an emotionally loaded word would be theft. People think it is morally wrong and thus may get emotional about theft, the act of taking something that is not yours. However, if we did not use the word theft to describe taking something that is not yours, we would think more critically about the action. For example, in this case consider a friend who took a jacket from their friend's house to deliver it to them. The jacket wasn't his but he took it for the sake of his friend. This would not be theft and should not be described as such. We should not treat love as emotionally- or morally-loaded. We must consider it more critically first.<br> 
 - Society recognizes beautiful love. People will not think it is shameful to do some things in the name of love they deem beautiful that would otherwise be shameful in the name of something else. A lover might sleep on his lover's doorsteps, starve himself, or even take his own life on behalf of his lover. Lots of people may deem this noble. Take for example a mother who sacrifices herself for her children. Most people find this honorable.

<p>3. Aristophanes</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Provides a fantasy detailing why we yearn for someone else. Long ago we existed as one organism with two faces, four arms, four legs, and 2 of everything that we currently have now. The gods split these organisms into 2 (which we are one of) which subsequently explains why we long to have a lover. We are trying to find our other half.<br>
- Gives explanation for hetero- and homosexuality. People split from male-female organisms are heterosexual and those split from same-sex organisms are homosexual.<br>
- Also gives explanation why some people seek exclusivity in their relationships.<br>
- Aristophanes claims that although people often judge homosexuality as the lesser of the two sexualities (here hetero- and homosexuality), homosexuals are the greater. The subtext here indicates that homosexuals aren't as we know them today (two people of the same sex who participate in sexual activity with one another) but people of the same sex that simply love being in company. I may be wrong about the subtext--since Greeks were especially fond of pederasty (male-male sexual interactions).
</p>
</font>
<p>4. Agathon</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Claims that everyone didn't explain what love is. Just why its important or how someone can experience it.<br>
- Agathon says that love is beautiful and gentle. You can verify that love is gentle because its able to spread from everyone's souls which are all soft. Love is also not violent. Love has all the virtues one can think of.<br>
- This is a very different praise than the previous speakers--who were all pretty realistic about love--grounding love in some way to people on earth. Agathon on the other hand is simply discussing the properties of love independent of the people on this earth.<br>
