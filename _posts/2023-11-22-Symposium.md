## Summary
<p>0. Context</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Socrates is at a banquet with friends. They are celebrating Agathon at his home. Over some alcohol, Eryximachus, a friend at the banquet, challenges everyone to offer a praise to love.
</p>
</font>
<p>1. Phaedrus</p>
 <font size="-1">
 <p>
 - Love is the best thing we can have because we feel the most ashamed in front of our lovers. Imagine that you've just done something embarassing like fumble a speech at some celebration. We'd feel the most embarassed when our lover is there as a witness as opposed to when our lover is absent. The assumption here is that because we feel the most shame in front of someone we love, we care most about what they must think of us. This is a sign that love is one of the most important things to us.<br>
 - Only lovers are willing to die on behalf of one another. The fact that people are willing to put their life on the line over love shows its importance and the respect we ought to have for love.

<p>2. Pausanias/Eryximachus</p>
 <font size ="-1">
 <p>
 - Love is an action and we can ascribe whether love is beautiful or ugly ourselves. Consider the act of pressing a knife into someone's chest. If done by a surgeon on a patient, the act may be labeled heroic. If done by a thief on the street, the act is criminal. It is the same with acts of love. We need to inquire about why the action was done to determine if love is beautiful or ugly. All in all then, love is beautiful if done beautifully and shameful if done shamefully.<br>
 - Points to a broader issue of emotionally-loaded language. Pausanias thinks that love is not an emotionally loaded word. An example of an emotionally loaded word would be theft. People think it is morally wrong and thus may get emotional about theft, the act of taking something that is not yours. However, if we did not use the word theft to describe taking something that is not yours, we would think more critically about the action. For example, in this case consider a friend who took a jacket from their friend's house to deliver it to them. The jacket wasn't his but he took it for the sake of his friend. This would not be theft and should not be described as such. We should not treat love as emotionally- or morally-loaded. We must consider it more critically first.<br> 
 - Society recognizes beautiful love. People will not think it is shameful to do some things in the name of love they deem beautiful that would otherwise be shameful in the name of something else. A lover might sleep on his lover's doorsteps, starve himself, or even take his own life on behalf of his lover. Lots of people may deem this noble. Take for example a mother who sacrifices herself for her children. Most people find this honorable.

<p>3. Aristophanes</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Provides a fantasy detailing why we yearn for someone else. Long ago we existed as one organism with two faces, four arms, four legs, and 2 of everything that we currently have now. The gods split these organisms into 2 (which we are one of) which subsequently explains why we long to have a lover. We are trying to find our other half.<br>
- Gives explanation for hetero- and homosexuality. People split from male-female organisms are heterosexual and those split from same-sex organisms are homosexual.<br>
- Also gives explanation why some people seek exclusivity in their relationships.<br>
- Aristophanes claims that although people often judge homosexuality as the lesser of the two sexualities (here hetero- and homosexuality), homosexuals are the greater. The subtext here indicates that homosexuals aren't as we know them today (two people of the same sex who participate in sexual activity with one another) but people of the same sex that simply love being in company. I may be wrong about the subtext--since Greeks were especially fond of pederasty (male-male sexual interactions).
</p>
</font>
<p>4. Agathon</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Claims that everyone didn't explain what love is. Just why its important or how someone can experience it.<br>
- Agathon says that love is beautiful and gentle. You can verify that love is gentle because its able to spread from everyone's souls which are all soft. Love is also not violent. Love has all the virtues one can think of.<br>
- This is a very different praise than the previous speakers--who were all pretty realistic about love--grounding love in some way to people on earth. Agathon on the other hand is simply discussing the properties of love independent of the people on this earth.<br>
</p>
</font>
<p>5. Socrates</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Refutes Agathon's claim that love is beautiful and good. Love is not an independent object--love is relational. Love is of something, like a father is of a child. Because love is of something and, inherent, at least partly, to the definition of love, is a wanting for another thing (like a woman loves a man implies that she wants him, or a baby loving a food implies that the baby wants that food), then love must want something else that is broadly categorized as beautiful/good. Because its impossible to want something you currently have, love cannot be beautiful or good, because this is what love wants.<br>
- This argument assumes that love is what wants and not the lover--which is not the case. However even considering that its the lover doing the loving, the argument still stands. The lover is the one doing the wanting, and the lover wants something beautiful or good. We cannot say that love itself is beautiful or good, because again love is relational. To have love, the lover must have the object of which is to be loved. So love independently cannot be beautiful. There must be some object to relate that love too.
- Agathon admits that he was illogical and cannot contradict Socrates. Socrates corrects him saying that he cannot contradict the truth.

<p>6. Socrates on Diotima</p>
<font size="-1">
<p>
- Diotima reaffirms Socrates' response to Agathon.<br>
- Diotima describes origin of love. Love was conceived on the day Aphrodites was born (the goddess of beauty). Love was conceived by 2 gods, the god of resourcefulness, courage, and eagerness and the goddess of poverty, homelessness, and wanting. Love is actually scrappy, wanting, courageous, and resourceful. Love is not beautiful.<br>
- Socrates originally thought love was the beautiful thing but this makes no sense because we love beautiful things. So can you love love? No because you must love something else. For example, people may love the relationship they form with another person and they're conflating that relationship with "love"--which if incorrect. Diotima says that love is a philosopher who seeks beautiful things. Wisdom is a beautiful thing.<br>
- Why does love desire beautiful things? In other words, why do people love beautiful things? Because it makes them happy. That answer is sufficient to Diotima. Love is a wish for happiness. One could inquire on the meaning of happiness which really is just a game of one man's trash is another's treasure. One person claims that his wife brings him the most happiness. The person inquiring on this happiness should find that answer final unless the inquirer wants to change the other person's source of happiness--for example maybe the wife shouldn't bring happiness.<br>
- Love is not just of beautiful things for the sake of happiness. Love is about having that beautiful thing forever. Love is about immortal happiness.
- Provides explanation on why all organisms strive to reproduce. Offspring are beautiful and a method of leaving something inherent to our nature on this earth. Offspring is the closest thing we can have to having beauty for all time. Hence finding a mate we deem beautiful and producing something from the both of you must therefore must also be beautiful is a way to obtain immortal beauty.<br>
- This assumes that organisms themselves must believe they're beautiful. A beautiful self mating with a beautiful mate should produce a beautiful offspring as opposed to an un-beautiful self mating with a beautiful mate. The next question may be--is beauty subjective per individual? Socrates would surely say beauty is beauty. We love beautiful things. But Mike's wife is surely different than John's wife. Do the wives have the same beauty?
- Also provides explanation of why people, even if they don't bear children, also have an inclination to invent or discover things. For their invention or discoveries are also beautiful and can attempt to be made eternal. Point is--people love beautiful immortal things. Not just beautiful things.
- Love can be seen like a ladder--where the first rung is love of a single beautiful body, the next multiple beautiful bodies, then beautiful souls (of which I am interpreting as the non-physical components of a person--their psyche and behaviors), and eventually beauty itself. The ultime form of love is love for the form of beauty--and hence we are just loving all that is beautiful itself.<br>
- This love for all beautiful things, or even the higher loves in Diotima's ladder is what platonic love is. There is no need for sexual interaction to maintain this level of love.
