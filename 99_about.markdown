My name is Micheal and I'm currently at [Athelas](https://www.athelas.com/) where we aim to decentralize lab tests and improve workflows for patients and physicians. We also manage revenue for practices. I have had a deep interest in healthcare ever since my dad broke his neck rendering him paralyzed from the neck down. My work has spanned from remote health monitoring to underlying cell signaling pathways.

If you're interested in learning more about my projects (some of which I am proud of and others am not and thus may re-visit), please see the links below!
