My name is Micheal and I'm currently at [Athelas](https://www.athelas.com/) where we aim to decentralize lab tests and improve workflows for patients and physicians. We have 2 goals:

1. Increase clinician time per encounter
2. Decrease the administrative cost per dollar earned

I build internal tools for general revenue cycle operations like electronic health record (EHR) extraction and electronic data interchange (EDI) setup for our operations team. My primary aim as of October 2023 is to scale electronic claim submission and reconciliation. I've previously worked in the blood diagnostics division aiming to bring platelet counts to the point of care.

 I have had a deep interest in healthcare ever since my dad broke his neck rendering him paralyzed from the neck down. My work before Athelas has centered around remote health monitoring and  underlying cell signaling pathways. Please see my projects/previous work page for more.
