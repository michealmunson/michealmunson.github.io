<h3>Design and performance of a point-of-care, automated platelet counter on capillary blood samples</h3>

</p>

At Athelas (2021 to current), a team and I worked on a point-of-care platelet counter to make the complete blood cell count more accessible to patients at home. Patients who need to monitor platelet counts regularly stress personal and hospital resources. We therefore developed a minitiarized microscope with a controller and a convolutional neural network capable of platelet counting. Our work is published in <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/142/Supplement%201/5453/505742/Design-and-Performance-of-a-Low-Cost-Portable">Blood</a>.

</p>

In college (2016 to 2020), a team and I validated a convolutional neural network constructed in-house on an ~80K large dataset composed of children with a variety of eye conditions. The neural network classifies leukocoria--a symptom of a variety of eye conditions. The model combines 3 types of classifiers (artificial neural neutwork-based, support vector machines, discriminant analysis-based) which perform well on multichannel detection of leukocoria. The validation paper is published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax6363">Science Advances</a>.

<h3>Understanding the signaling mechanism for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension for potential therapeutic targeting</h3>

</p>

In college (2016 to 2020), a team and I studied the underlying signaling pathway responsible for the proliferative behavior observed in the smooth muscle of the pulmonary artery in an idiopathic, hypertensive state. Our pulmonary arteries are lined with endothelial and smooth muscle cells--all of which play a particular function in maintaining the artery's state. Some people have abnormally high blood pressure in their pulmonary arteries which may lead to right heart failure. My work is published in the <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.05208">Faseb Journal</a>.
